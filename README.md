# Liquid Glass UI Prototype

A minimal front-end prototype exploring the **liquid glass** design language:
layered glass panels, fluid gradients, and motion that feels suspended within a
viscous medium.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The page renders a responsive layout
with:

- A hero glass module describing the liquid glass principles
- Animated floating color fields on a canvas backdrop that respond to pointer
  movement
- Token panels demonstrating color wells, depth blur levels, and motion
  viscosities

No build tooling is required.
